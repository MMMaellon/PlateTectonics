# Plate Tectonics

This prefab moves your entire world so that the local player stays still when standing on a moving platform. From the player's perspective, it'll look like they're moving with the platform. It also syncs player positions to remote clients using chairs so everyone is in sync.

Install through VCC by visiting [My Master VCC Listing](https://mmmaellon.github.io/MMMaellonVCCListing/) or by visiting [This Prefab's VCC Listing](https://mmmaellon.github.io/PlateTectonics/). You can also download the .zip from either of these listings to try and install the prefab manually without VCC if you want.

**NOTE: prefab uses chairs to sync positions, so if you have a chair in your map, you'll need to put the player back into their chair when they exit your map's chair. Also moving the entire world might slightly alter physics simulations.**
